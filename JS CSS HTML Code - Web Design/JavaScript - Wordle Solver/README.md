# Wordle Solver
In the C.O.D.E.R.S. club that I lead at Sattler, we wrote a short JavaScript site to solve Wordle.

## How It Works
You store a "target" word that is compared against each guessed word to see if it's correct. If the letter in a guessed word is in the correct spot, click it twice to turn it green and once to turn it yellow if it is in the target word but not placed correctly. The algorithm eliminates letters that remain gray.
