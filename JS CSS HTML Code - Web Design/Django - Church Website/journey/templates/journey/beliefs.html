        I believe in God, the Father almighty,<br>
        creator of heaven and earth.<br><br>

        I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord.<br>
        He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit<br>
        and born of the Virgin Mary.<br>
        He suffered under Pontius Pilate,<br>
        was crucified, died, and was buried.<br>
        He descended to the dead.<br>
        On the third day he rose again.<br>
        He ascended into heaven,<br>
        and is seated at the right hand of the Father.<br>
        He will come again to judge the living and the dead.<br><br>

        I believe in the Holy Spirit,<br>
        the holy catholic Church*,<br>
        the communion of saints,<br>
        the forgiveness of sins,<br>
        the resurrection of the body,<br>
        and the life everlasting. Amen.<br><br>
