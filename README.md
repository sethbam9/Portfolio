## About Me
I am a passionate computer science student. I love to learn and to create. As part of the inaugural graduating class at a small college, I had to own my learning experience. This included lots of self-learning, collaboration with other students, and experimentation. Through projects and personal exploration, I fell in love with the objected-oriented paradigm and back end programming (see "Passion Projects"). I also co-founded my school's Computer Science Association, C.O.D.E.R.S., of which I am currently president. We meet weekly and work on coding challenges, such as developing Wordle solvers and terminal RPGs. 

## Passion Projects

### Computer Science Capstone: [A Hebrew Literacy App](https://github.com/sethbam9/Hebrew-Literacy-App)
I've always enjoyed languages (e.g., Kiswahili, Greek, Hebrew) and am a person who pays close attention to detail. I'm therefore intrigued by the fields of computational lingustics and NLP. For my capstone I am combining a huge amount of backend development in Python and app development in Flutter to produce a mobile app that will empower students of ancient Hebrew to increase their literacy. My deliverable will be an functional app prototype in May. I however plan to continue my work on it after graduation and to publish it on the app store. 

### Community Service / Coding for Social Good
Since beginning my CS studies, I've been intentional about using code for the good of others during my spare time. This has included tasks like helping people with website development/hosting.
