## About Me
I am a passionate computer science student. I love to learn and to create. As part of the inaugural graduating class at a small college, I had to own my learning experience. This included lots of self-learning, collaboration with other students, and experimentation. Through projects and personal exploration, I fell in love with the objected-oriented paradigm and back end programming (see "Passion Projects"). I also co-founded my school's Computer Science Association, C.O.D.E.R.S., of which I am currently president. We meet weekly and work on coding challenges, such as developing Wordle solvers and terminal RPGs. 

## Passion Projects

### Computer Science Capstone: [A Hebrew Literacy App](https://github.com/sethbam9/Hebrew-Literacy-App)
I've always enjoyed languages (e.g., Kiswahili, Greek, Hebrew) and am a person who pays close attention to detail. I'm therefore intrigued by the fields of computational linguistics and NLP. For my capstone I am combining a substantial amount of backend development in Python and app development in Flutter to produce a mobile app that will empower thousands of students of ancient Hebrew to increase their literacy. My deliverable will be a functional app prototype in May, 2022. I plan to continue my work on the app after graduation and to publish it in the app store. 

**Back end work:**
- Data cleaning and preparation: I aligned an open source SQL database with a CSV file database (both with roughly 400,000 rows x 20+ columns) that each had attractive features into a single SQL database to be used as the textual foundation for my app. See my reproducible and documented data preparation process [here](https://github.com/sethbam9/Hebrew-Literacy-App/blob/main/data_code/convert_csv_data_v3.ipynb).
- Lexical passage weight-rank algorithm: I taught myself the Python [Text-Fabric API](https://annotation.github.io/text-fabric/tf/index.html) and used it to parse the entire Masoretic Text (Hebrew Old Testament) into ~2,000 weighted units of text with bucketed vocabulary groupings. This data will be used to create a graded reading and vocab platform for app users by matching texts with users based off of a user's current known vocab data. See my documented work [here](https://github.com/sethbam9/Hebrew-Literacy-App/blob/main/data_code/passage_extraction/tf_passage_weights_v2.ipynb).

### Community Service / Coding for Social Good
Since beginning my CS studies, I've been intentional about using code for the good of others during my spare time. This has included tasks like helping people with website development/hosting. 

**My current project:**
- I am developing a Django "House to House" website with a back end algorithm that matches community members together for meals and takes into account things like household size, ability to host, and previous matches. I am using it for a local organization, but hope to make it scalable for other communities to adopt.
