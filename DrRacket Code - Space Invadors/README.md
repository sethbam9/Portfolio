# Space Invadors
[Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) is a functional programming language that we used in my Program Design course to learn the ins and outs of designing functions. For our final project we wrote a basic space invadors game. Check out the [code file](https://github.com/sethbam9/Portfolio/blob/main/DrRacket%20Code%20-%20Space%20Invadors/space_invadors.rkt) to get a feel for the language and to see our documentation.
