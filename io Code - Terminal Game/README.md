The io programming language is 


Key concepts for the language and/or language paradigm, with examples:
	• Prototype language -> everything is something else’s object, being derived from an original prototype.
	• Minimal syntax makes it simple and consistent.
	
	About Objects in Io
	• Every thing is an object.
	• Every interaction with an object is a message.
	• You don’t instantiate classes; you clone other objects called prototypes.
	• Objects remember their prototypes.
	• Objects have slots.
	• Slots contain objects, including method objects.
	• A message returns the value in a slot or invokes the method in a slot.
	• If an object can’t respond to a message, it sends that message to its prototype.
	 
	
Challenges in getting the language running:
Where to download: https://iobin.suspended-chord.info/
Note the ReadMe instructions to drag libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll into the same folder as io.exe after running IoLanguage-2013.11.05-win32.exe

Tools (beyond the textbook) for using the language:
	• Editors: Try Sublime text3 and use the Io support: https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Io%20Language. 
	• Interpreters: Use the command prompt / shell.
	• Online interpreters: N/A
