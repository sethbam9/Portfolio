# Hebrew Optical Character Recognition

## Summary
For our Machine Learning course, my classmate Cody and I collected over 20 sheets with handwritten Hebrew characters and wrote Python functions to label the data into a subdirectory for each letter of the alphabet. We then used TensorFlow's Sequential Keras neural network to classify the characters. Read about the full process in our [write up](https://github.com/sethbam9/Portfolio/blob/main/Python%20Code%20-%20Hebrew%20OCR/Machine%20Learning%20Write%20Up.pdf).
